# Drowsy-Driver-Detction
Ubuntu-based solution for Drowsy Driver Detection, utilizing OpenCV and dlib libraries in Python to monitor and analyze driver alertness
The system captures real-time video footage via a webcam, processing facial landmarks to assess eye movements and blink rates, which are key indicators of drowsiness. The detection algorithm identifies three states: "Active," "Drowsy," and "Sleeping," based on the driver's eye behaviour. When drowsiness is detected, an audible alarm is triggered using a wav sound file to alert the driver and prevent potential accidents.
